I am happy to announce that `Windows Hours Tracker` for Windows Phone has been downloaded 10,000 times. This is some kind of extra motivation for me.

In the near future there will be a beta release of the upcoming version 2.0. If you are interessted, drop me some lines using [one of the different possibilities to contact me](http://devtyr.com/contact.html "DevTyr Contact").

Thank you very much!
