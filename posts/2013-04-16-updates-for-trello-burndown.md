Version 0.8 of [trello-burndown](http://devtyr.github.io/trello-burndown/ "trello-burndown") will be available soon. If you won't wait, get the latest bits from [GitHub](https://github.com/devtyr/trello-burndown "trello-burndown on GitHub"). This is what have changed since version 0.7:

### Bugs

* Sprint was disabled one day to early
* `export` and `config` folders are created on startup now if they don't exist
* Removed `d3.js` as a NPM module due to incompatibility with node 0.10.x; added as a static resource
* Clarified statistics

### Features

* Mouseover for data points
* Support of multiple finished lists

There are some features left for the upcoming version, but they are in progress. Version 0.8 should be out soon.
