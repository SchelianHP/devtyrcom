Working Hours Tracker for Windows Phone is a free tool to track your work hours. It supports hourly rates, projects, activities and more.

Version 1.8 will be available at the marketplace soon. There are a lot of improvements based on user's feedback.

* Better performance. There was a lot of feedback that the app is getting slow when having more and more time records. This should be better now, as not everything is loaded everytime, just when it's needed. Furthermore there won't be a reload when no records have changed or added.
* Renamed `export` into `backup`. This was a misleading translation as this main menu item makes a backup of the databases (in case you have to restore it someday). There is also some more help text to let the user know where to find the export functionality.
* The `monthly list` got a new design. There was a lot of feedback to show the `description` permanently. Additionally also the activity of the record (if set) will be shown now. The break time has been removed, as this should be less important. The list itself should also be faster now.
* While logging on to Dropbox the page title hides now. Some of you reported that it is not possible to login to Dropbox. In fact, this was because you have to scroll down to see the `Allow` and `Block` buttons. This isn't the case any more. You should see them.
* If acitivities are in use and there was **only one** activity associated with a project, the association for a new time record wasn't set correctly. This is fixed now.
* Projects can be set as inactive for some versions now. Inactive projects don't come up within the project selection. Since 1.8 inactive projects aren't shown in the project summaries any more. This helps you focusing on active projects. Furthermore this helps improving performance.
* Smaller icons for main menu tiles. They should look better now.

I did also some minor fixes that are not mentioned in detail as you would not see any effect in handling or the user interface. Most of them are for improved stability and better performance.

Thank you very much for your feedback. It is really important to improve this app.
