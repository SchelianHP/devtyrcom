For [my projects](https://github.com/devtyr?tab=repositories "DevTyr repositories") based on [Trello](http://trello.com "Trello") I used a node module called [trello](https://npmjs.org/package/trello "trello node module"). This is based on another module called [restler](https://npmjs.org/package/restler "restler node module"). 'restler' was pretty cool, but isn't maintained any more. This isn't fine as there is an incompatibility to node 0.10.x.

Therefore I decided to fork the Trello API client module: [trello_ex](https://github.com/devtyr/trello "trello_ex Trello API client for node.js"). It is also available via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/trello_ex "trello_ex NPM"). It is based on another RESTful client which works with 0.8 and 0.10.x. Earlier versions of node haven't been tested. Furthermore I added some helpful functions.
