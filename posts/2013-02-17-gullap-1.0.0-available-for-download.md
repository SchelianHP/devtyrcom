Some days ago I [wrote about Gullap](http://news.devtyr.com/post/gullap-the-static-website-generator-mono "Gullap - The static website generator (Mono)"), the latest project of DevTyr. It is a static website generator for Mono/.NET, running on Windows and Linux. Per default Gullap supports [Nustache](https://github.com/jdiamond/Nustache "Nustache") (a [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/ "Mustache") port) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown"). Both can be changed by an own implementation.

Now, Gullap is available for [download](http://devtyr.com/gullap-download.html "Gullap download"). If you won't compile it by your own, you can get the binaries, otherwise the source is also hosted on GitHub. See the download page for additional information.

Get an overview and [see what Gullap is able to do](http://devtyr.com/gullap.html "Gullap - The static website generator"). Finally, have a look at the [how to pages](http://devtyr.com/gullap-howto.html "Gullap How To") to learn about setting up your environment and mastering your templates.

If you have questions, ideas, bug reports, don't hesitate to contact via [@devtyr_com](http://twitter.com/devtyr_com "@devtyr_com on Twitter") or the [G+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/101936208491451882859 "DevTyr G+ community"). It is also possible, and yes, recommended, to post issues to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/devtyr/gullap/issues "Gullap Issue Tracker").
