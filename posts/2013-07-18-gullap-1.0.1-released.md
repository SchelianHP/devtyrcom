Some months ago I released [Gullap 1.0.0](http://news.devtyr.com/post/gullap-1.0.0-available-for-download "Gullap 1.0.0 available for download"). Gullap is a static website generator for .NET/Mono. Today I released version 1.0.1 of gullap. This is a minor update coming with new meta tags for your pages/posts:

* `Date`: The creation/update date of your post. This value is also available within your templates.
* `Directory`: Define into which sub-directory the page should be generated.
* `Metatags`: Define meta tags for your page. These are also available within your templates.

Visit the [Gullap project page](http://devtyr.com/projects/gullap/gullap.html "Gullap - Mono based static website generator") and get the latest binaries as well as the latest source code.
