[trello-burndown](http://devtyr.github.com/trello-burndown/ "trello-burndown") is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org "node.js") based tool to generate burndown charts from your [Trello](http://trello.com "Trello") cards. As there were a lot of questions concerning this tool and the "process" behind of it, I decided to write a book that describes the way to that solution, the ideas behind of it and in general of your decision of moving to Scrum.

The book is still in progress. About **15%** are finished yet. I decided to publish it very soon to get a lot of feedback at an early time. It is planned to update the book every week until it is finished.
