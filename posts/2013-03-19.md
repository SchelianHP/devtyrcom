Some days ago I [announced](http://news.devtyr.com/post/working-hours-tracker-1.8-wp "Working Hours Tracker 1.8") the upcoming version 1.8 of Working Hours Tracker for Windows Phone.

**It's available now.**

New users can find it within the Marketplace by searching for `Working Hours Tracker` or by clicking the [direkt link](http://www.windowsphone.com/de-de/store/app/working-hours-tracker/9112f9bb-6687-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8 "Working Hours Tracker for Windows Phone").
