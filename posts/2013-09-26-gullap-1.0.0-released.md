`Gullap` 1.1.0 is available now. This version includes a lot of changes. Some of them are breaking changes, but they were necessary to improve functionality and to prepare future work on this project. Here is a list of changes:

* The meta data of each page have to be defined with an YAML front matter now. This is much more powerful than before, but breaks existing pages.
* The parameter `-g` for the console application can be called without defining the site's path. In that case the current directory will be used as the site path.
* There are much more variables available within your template. This gives them some extra power.
* Added site configuration (optional). This isn't very powerful at the moment but will be extented in future versions.

For further information have a look at the [how to](http://devtyr.com/projects/gullap/gullap-howto.html "Gullap How To"). The latest version can be [downloaded here](http://devtyr.com/projects/gullap/gullap-download.html "Gullap Download").

## Future

Version 1.2.0 will be the next big step. It will provide the possibility to generate *blog posts* and to handle them in an appropriate way. Furthermore it will be possible to provide *custom variables* within the YAML front matter that can be evaluated in your templates.
