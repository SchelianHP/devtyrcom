## About

For more than two years [Kai Gloth](http://braindrivendevelopment.com/ ".Kai Blog - A Coffeegeek about Software Development, C# and moreâ€¦") and [Norbert Eder](http://www.norberteder.com "Norbert Eder") collected the best posts of our blogs and generated the *.NET BlogBook*. It covers several topics of the .NET world.

This pages were available at [http://www.dotnet-blogbook.com](http://www.dotnet-blogbook.com) for some years now. People downloaded the blog book over 50,000 times. But time goes by and priorities shifted. So we decided to discontinue this projects. All editions are still available for download, maybe they help someone. If so, please let us know.
