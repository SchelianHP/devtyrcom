    	<h2>Efficiency</h2>
    	<p>Nothing is more frustrating than inefficient tools and processes. Fast response and a powerful experience is a must!</p>

    	<h2>FireAndForget</h2>
    	<p>Mostly an Enterprise Service Bus is oversized and difficult to configure and to maintain. This is a "fire and forget" implementation which is really easy to configure, asynchronous and extensible.</p>
