            This pages were available at <a href="http://www.dotnet-blogbook.com">http://www.dotnet-blogbook.com</a> for some years now. People downloaded the blog book over <strong>50,000 times</strong>. But time goes by and priorities shifted. So we decided to discontinue this projects. All editions are still available for download, maybe they help someone. If so, please let us know.
