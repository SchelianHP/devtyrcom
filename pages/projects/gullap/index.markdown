## About

Gullap is a [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com "Mono") based static website generator. It's similiar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Jekyll") which is running on Ruby. 

There are not a lot tools running under .NET and Windows, one of them is [pretzel](https://github.com/Code52/pretzel "pretzel"). Not the right solution for me, it should be easier.

And here we go. **Gullap** was born.

It's in an very early stage, but was able to create the site you are watching right now. All content is written with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown"), which is THE supported markup language. Using [Nustache](https://github.com/jdiamond/Nustache "Nustache") (an implementation of [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/ "Mustache")) templates are an very important part of Gullap. For this page [Bootstrap from Twitter](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/ "Bootstrap from Twitter") is used.
